Sublime-RGBDS 2.0.0 changelog:

Fully rewrote syntax, using better techniques:

 - Rewritten using RGBASM's own syntax definition, should be more accurate

 - Syntax should be more lenient and recover from syntax errors better; please however note that RGBASM syntax is impossible to highlight correctly in some cases, so minor blunders are to be expected

 - Macro invocations are now kept track of, and considered as functions

 - Some indentation rules have been fixed, such as `ELSE` not de-denting when typed

 - Added syntax tests on my end to catch future regressions

Given the size of the changes, please let me know ("Issues" link on https://packagecontrol.io/packages/RGBDS) if this update broke your workflow somehow, or if there are glaring syntax errors.

Known bugs:

 - Section types and attributes are not auto-completed anymore, I can't figure out how to trigger them

 - Line continuation support was attempted, but doesn't work for a reason I don't understand
