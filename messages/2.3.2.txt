Sublime-RGBDS 2.3.2 changelog:

 - The `BREAK` directive is now recognized (oops)
 - "Strings" in macro args properly end at EOL (fixes major breakage)
 - Nested interpolations now work properly, too.
 - Unclosed brackets no longer cause major breakage.
 - Character escapes and `STRFMT` format specifiers are now highlighted in strings.
 - Escaped commas in macro args are now highlighted differently, instead of just not highlighted like regular commas.
 - Comments after macro args and interpolations will now be highlighted; this should yield a few false positives, but they should be rare.
