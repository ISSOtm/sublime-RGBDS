The syntax definition was cleaned up significantly!
 - Line continuations are now *finally* functional!
 - Builtin string symbols are now recognised as strings, and properly highlighted
 - Improved handling of interpolations and macro args
 - And more fixes!
 - Some syntax that was deprecated in v0.7.0 has been removed
